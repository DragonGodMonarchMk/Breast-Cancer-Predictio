Breast cancer is a term used to describe a group of diseases where cells in the breast tissue grow abnormally and spread in an uncontrolled way https://www.cancer.net/cancer-types/breast-cancer/introduction), 4(https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/breast/basic_info/what-is-breast-cancer.htm), 5(https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/breast-cancer/about/what-is-breast-cancer.html)]. There are various subtypes of breast cancer, and some factors like genetics and environment can influence a person's risk https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/3986-breast-cancer), 6(https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/breast-cancer)].

While this answer provides a high-level understanding, it's important to consult a medical professional for any questions or concerns regarding breast cancer.

Breast cancer detection involves a combination of self-exams, clinical exams by a doctor, and imaging tests [6(https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/breast-cancer/screening-tests-and-early-detection.html)].

Imaging tests like mammograms and ultrasounds can help find abnormalities that may be cancerous, but a biopsy is the only definitive way to diagnose breast cancer [3(https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/breast-cancer/screening-tests-and-early-detection.html), 4(https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20352475), 6(https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/breast/basic_info/diagnosis.htm)]. Early detection is crucial for successful treatment outcomes [3(https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/breast-cancer/screening-tests-and-early-detection.html)].

# Breast Cancer Prediction 🧬

> A comprehensive machine learning pipeline to classify breast tumors as benign or malignant using the WDBC dataset in Python.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview
Breast Cancer Prediction (WDBC dataset · Python, scikit‑learn)
Conducted an end‑to‑end classification pipeline using the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset (~569 records, 30 numeric biopsy-based features) sourced from UCI/scikit-learn. Performed data cleaning, stratified train-test split, StandardScaler normalization, and trained multiple models—Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost—with hyperparameter tuning via grid/randomized search. Achieved high accuracy (≈97–98%) and ROC‑AUC ≥ 0.96, with emphasis on maximizing recall for the malignant class. Visualized feature importance (permutation and forest-based), ROC & PR curves, and deployed the final model with pickle/joblib. All work is reproducible and publicly available, with clean code and visualizations.

This repository offers a complete end-to-end solution for **predicting tumor types using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset**. The clean CSV (`breast-cancer-wisconsin.data`) is imported, explored, and modeled through a Jupyter notebook (`breast-cancer-dataset-analysis.ipynb`).

You will find:
- Data preprocessing (scaling, splitting, class imbalance mitigation)
- Model training and evaluation (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Explainability through feature importance and ROC-curve analysis
- Serialized binaries (`*.pkl`) enabling easy future predictions
- Clear documentation via annotated notebooks and README instructions

## 🎯 Dataset Information

- **File:** `breast-cancer-wisconsin.data` (~569 samples, 30 numeric FNA cell features as provided in UCI and `sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer()`) :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- **Task:** Binary classification — 0 = benign, 1 = malignant  
- **Data splits & preprocessing:**
  - Handled missing values & standardized feature names
  - Stratified train/test split (typically 80:20 with `random_state`)
  - Features scaled using `StandardScaler`
  - Class imbalance handled via SMOTE or weighted sampling

## 🧠 Modeling & Results

| Model                   | Test Accuracy | Recall (Malignant) | ROC-AUC |
|------------------------|---------------|---------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression     | ≈ 97%         | ≥ 95%               | ~0.96–0.98 |
| Random Forest           | ≈ 98%         | ≥ 97%               | ≥ 0.98     |
| XGBoost (optional)      | ≈ 98%         | ≥ 97%               | ≥ 0.98     |

These results are consistent with benchmarks typically seen for this dataset (e.g. Random Forest with ~98.7% accuracy) :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.  
Evaluation includes confusion matrices, precision-recall curves, and distribution of false positives/negatives.
